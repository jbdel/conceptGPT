1. Occlusive thrombus in multiple pulmonary arterial branches with downstream consolidation and possible pulmonary infarction or septic emboli. 2. Multiple non-specific pulmonary nodules. 3. Bilateral pleural effusions with possible focal infection on the left. 4. Focal bullous in the left upper lobe. 5. Normal heart size and patent tracheobronchial tree. 6. Homogeneous thyroid gland without focal nodule and no lymphadenopathy identified.
1. Large intraluminal filling defect at the left main pulmonary artery, consistent with pulmonary embolism. 2. Intraluminal filling defects in the pulmonary arteries supplying the right lower lobe. 3. Stable appearance of multiple pulmonary nodules, not significantly changed from the prior study. 4. Minimal pleural thickening posteriorly in the left lung. 5. No significant pericardial or pleural effusion. 6. Several small mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. 7. No significant axillary lymphadenopathy. 8. The visualized portions of the abdomen, including the liver, spleen, and stomach appear unremarkable. 9. Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
1. Left upper lobe lung mass with contiguous enlarged aorticopulmonary lymph node, which has slightly decreased in size since prior examination. 2. Evidence of lymph node enlargement in the left supraclavicular region with a node previously measuring 12 x 15 mm currently measuring 12 x 19 mm and several other nodes in this region appear slightly increased in size. 3. New diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly involving the upper and middle lobes with relative sparing of the lower lobes, suggestive of radiation. 4. New small left pleural effusion. 5. New 6 mm round nodule in the right lower lobe with a slightly lobulated contour and several smaller noncalcified nodules in the left lower lobe which were not seen in the prior study. 6. Bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe which is unchanged and a focal calcification within this consistent with a broncholith. 7. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
1. Suboptimal opacification of pulmonary arteries with possible segmental embolism cannot be excluded. 2. Extensive airtrapping and moderate bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. 3. No pericardial or pleural effusion. 4. Mild centrilobular emphysema and mid thoracic osteophytosis. 5. Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central venous catheters. 6. Moderately severe hepatic steatosis.
1) Eccentric ascending aortic dissection extending to the aortic arch with an intramural hematoma adjacent to the distal segment and extension to the left subclavian takeoff. 2) No extension of the dissection into the origins of the great vessels or the coronary arteries. 3) Normal main pulmonary artery caliber and patent with no pulmonary embolism seen to the segmental levels. 4) Normal heart size with no pericardial or pleural effusion. 5) Well-aerated lungs with no pneumothorax.
1. Bilateral pleural effusions with resulting compressive subsegmental atelectasis. 2. Small parenchymal pulmonary opacities in the left lower lobe consistent with pulmonary contusion. 3. Right upper lobe nodular/ground glass opacities may be inflammatory or infectious. 4. No residual pneumothorax seen, but subcutaneous emphysema tracks around the site of the left chest tube. 5. Limited axial images of the upper abdomen appear unremarkable.
1. Soft tissue abnormality at the level of the anastomosis with extension into the mediastinum and an area of low density suggestive of necrosis. Pathologically enlarged lymph node seen inferior to the abnormality. Further evaluation is needed to determine the etiology of the abnormality. 2. Small left pleural effusion. 3. Moderate pulmonary emphysema. No evidence of lung nodules or masses.
The radiology report shows overall stability.
1. Moderate paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema predominates in the apical segments with thickening and slight irregularity involving all bronchial segments. 2. Scattered coronary atherosclerotic calcifications are most prominent in the left anterior descending artery. 3. No evidence of focal consolidation or pleural or pericardial effusion. 4. Intra-abdominal organs are unremarkable. 5. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions seen on bone windows.
1. The patient is status post esophagectomy and partial gastrectomy with gastric pull-through. 2. There is evidence of a complex right pleural collection containing air and fluid, consistent with a leak. The exact origin of the leak is not visualized. 3. There are prominent mediastinal lymph nodes, which do not meet CT criteria for pathological enlargement. 4. Lung windows demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left, and ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe. 5. There is no pericardial effusion. 6. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. 7. There is a small left pleural effusion.
