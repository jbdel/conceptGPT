1. Multiple occlusive thrombi in the pulmonary arterial branches with associated downstream consolidation and opacities, suggestive of pulmonary infarction or septic emboli. 2. Bilateral pleural effusions, with indeterminate characteristics on the left and possible focal infection. 3. Multiple non-specific pulmonary nodules, with the largest measuring 5 x 4 mm. 4. Focal bullous in the left upper lobe and compressive atelectasis in the left lung base. 5. Normal thyroid gland without focal nodule. 6. Minimal residual thymus in the anterior mediastinum.
1. Large intraluminal filling defect at the left main pulmonary artery, consistent with pulmonary embolism. 2. Intraluminal filling defects in the pulmonary arteries supplying the right lower lobe. 3. Stable appearance of multiple pulmonary nodules, not significantly changed from the prior study. 4. Minimal pleural thickening posteriorly in the left lung. 5. No significant pericardial or pleural effusion. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at the time of interpretation.
1. Left upper lobe lung mass with contiguous enlarged aorticopulmonary lymph node showing slight interval decrease in size. 2. New left pleural effusion and diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly involving the upper and middle lobes with relative sparing of the lower lobes. 3. New 6 mm round nodule in the right lower lobe with slightly lobulated contour and several smaller noncalcified nodules in the left lower lobe which were not seen in the prior study. 4. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
1. Suboptimal opacification of pulmonary arteries with possible segmental embolism cannot be excluded. 2. Extensive airtrapping and atelectasis in bilateral lower lobes, with moderate severity in left lower lobe and dense consolidation in right upper lobe that has resolved since previous exam. 3. Mild centrilobular emphysema and mild mid thoracic osteophytosis. 4. No pathologic enlargement of lymph nodes, pericardial or pleural effusion, or hepatic lesion. 5. Satisfactory position of endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central venous catheters, but side hole of nasogastric tube should be advanced to avoid aspiration.
1) Eccentric ascending aortic dissection (DeBakey type II) extending to the aortic arch with adjacent intramural hematoma and extension to the left subclavian takeoff. 2) No extension of the dissection into the origins of the great vessels or the coronary arteries. 3) Normal main pulmonary artery caliber and patent with no pulmonary embolism seen to the segmental levels. 4) Normal heart size with no pericardial or pleural effusion. 5) Well-aerated lungs with no pneumothorax. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ for further management.
1. Bilateral pleural effusions, small to moderate on the right and small on the left, with resulting compressive subsegmental atelectasis. 2. Small parenchymal pulmonary opacities in the left lower lobe consistent with pulmonary contusion. 3. Right upper lobe nodular/ground glass opacities may be inflammatory or infectious. 4. No residual pneumothorax seen, although subcutaneous emphysema tracks around the site of the left chest tube. 5. Limited axial images of the upper abdomen appear unremarkable.
1. Soft tissue abnormality in the region of the esophageal anastomosis with extension into the mediastinum and an area of low density suggestive of necrosis. Pathologically enlarged lymph node seen immediately inferior to the abnormality. 2. Small left pleural effusion. 3. Moderate pulmonary emphysema. No evidence of lung nodules or masses.
Overall stability is noted on the examination. No significant changes or abnormalities are identified. Further follow-up may be recommended based on clinical history and context.
1. Moderate paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema predominates in the apical segments with thickening and slight irregularity involving all bronchial segments. 2. Scattered coronary atherosclerotic calcifications are most prominent in the left anterior descending artery. 3. No focal consolidation or pleural or pericardial effusion is noted. 4. Intra-abdominal organs are unremarkable. 5. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are seen on bone windows.
1. The patient is status post esophagectomy and partial gastrectomy with gastric pull-through. 2. There is evidence of a leak in the complex right pleural collection, with extraluminal contrast seen at the level of the aortic arch. The exact origin of the leak is not visualized. 3. Prominent mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, but do not meet ct criteria for pathological enlargement. 4. Lung windows demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left, and ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe. 5. No pericardial effusion is identified. 6. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. 7. A small left pleural effusion is present.
