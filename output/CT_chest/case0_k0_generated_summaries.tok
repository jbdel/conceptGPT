1. Occlusive thrombus in multiple pulmonary arterial branches, with downstream consolidation and opacities suggestive of pulmonary infarction or septic emboli. 2. Non-specific sub-centimeter pulmonary nodules, with the largest measuring 5 x 4 mm in the left upper lobe. 3. Bilateral pleural effusions, with indeterminate characteristics in the left effusion and associated compressive atelectasis. 4. Focal bullous in the left upper lobe. 5. No focal nodule identified in the thyroid gland, which appears homogeneous. 6. No lymphadenopathy identified in the supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar regions. 7. Minimal residual thymus identified within the anterior mediastinum. 8. Normal heart size and no pericardial effusion. 9. Patent tracheobronchial tree to subsegmental levels.
The radiology report shows a large intraluminal filling defect at the left main pulmonary artery and intraluminal filling defects in the pulmonary arteries supplying the right lower lobe, consistent with pulmonary embolism. There are several small mediastinal lymph nodes, none of which meet the CT criteria for pathologic enlargement, and no significant axillary lymphadenopathy. The airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi bilaterally. On lung windows, there is a stable appearance of multiple pulmonary nodules, not significantly changed from the prior study, and minimal pleural thickening posteriorly in the left lung. The visualized portions of the abdomen, including the liver, spleen, and stomach, appear unremarkable. There is no evidence of significant pericardial or pleural effusion. Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions.
There is a left upper lobe lung mass which is contiguous with an enlarged aorticopulmonary lymph node, with effacement of the fat plane and possible invasion of the main pulmonary artery. The lung mass has decreased slightly in size from 37 x 76 mm to 25 x 74 mm, and is noted to extend into the anterior chest wall in the subcostal area between the first and second ribs. There is evidence of lymph node enlargement in the left supraclavicular region with a node previously measuring 12 x 15 mm currently measuring 12 x 19 mm and several other nodes in this region appear slightly increased in size. There is a new small left pleural effusion. The lung window images reveal new diffuse ground-glass opacities predominantly involving the upper and middle lobes with relative sparing of the lower lobes, and a region of more dense ground-glass opacification in the medial left lung with a geographic boundary consistent with more focal post radiation change. There is a new 6 mm round nodule in the right lower lobe with a slightly lobulated contour, and several smaller noncalcified nodules in the left lower lobe which were not seen in the prior study. The airways are notable for bronchiectasis in the right upper lobe which is unchanged and a focal calcification within this consistent with a broncholith. There is emphysema again noted. The visualized portions of the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.
Suboptimal opacification of the pulmonary arteries with no evidence of central pulmonary embolism or right heart strain, but a segmental embolism cannot be excluded. The pulmonary artery is at the upper limits of normal in size. The side hole of the nasogastric tube should be advanced by approximately 7 cm to avoid aspiration if used for feeding. No pathologic enlargement of the supraclavicular, axillary or mediastinal lymph nodes, with the largest node in the mediastinum measuring 9 mm in short axis dimension. Extensive left lower low airtrapping and moderately severe bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. Dense right upper lobe consolidation has completely resolved. Linear atelectasis in the right middle lobe has also improved, and left upper lobe atelectasis has completely resolved. Mild centrilobular emphysema. Atelectasis of the superior segment of the left lower lobe has progressed. The study is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation, only to mention surgical material along the greater curvature of the stomach and moderately severe hepatic steatosis. Mild mid thoracic osteophytosis.
There is an eccentric ascending aortic dissection extending to the aortic arch with an adjacent intramural hematoma seen on non-contrast exam. The dissection does not extend into the origins of the great vessels or the coronary arteries. The main pulmonary artery is patent and normal in caliber. The heart size is normal and there is no pericardial or pleural effusion. No pulmonary embolism is seen to the segmental levels and the lungs are well aerated with no pneumothorax.
Bilateral pleural effusions with resulting compressive subsegmental atelectasis, small to moderate on the right and small on the left, have developed since two days ago. There are small parenchymal pulmonary opacities in the left lower lobe consistent with pulmonary contusion, and right upper lobe nodular/ground glass opacities that may be inflammatory or infectious. No pulmonary embolism or residual pneumothorax is seen, although subcutaneous emphysema tracks around the site of the left chest tube, which apparently terminates just superior to the left lung apex. The heart, aorta, and great vessels appear normal. Limited axial images of the upper abdomen appear unremarkable.
Post-esophagectomy, there is a soft tissue abnormality involving the esophageal wall and extending into the mediastinum with an area of low density suggestive of necrosis. A pathologically enlarged lymph node measuring 1.5 x 1.5 cm is seen immediately inferior to this abnormality. No axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy is present. The mediastinal vasculature is unremarkable. A very small left pleural effusion is noted. Moderate pulmonary emphysema is present, but no lung nodules or masses are seen. No consolidation is present.
There is no significant change in the radiology findings, indicating overall stability.
Moderate paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema with thickening and slight irregularity involving all bronchial segments. No focal consolidation or pleural/pericardial effusion noted. Scattered coronary atherosclerotic calcifications, most prominent in the left anterior descending artery. Intra-abdominal organs are unremarkable. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions noted on bone windows. Heart size is normal.
The radiology report suggests that the patient, who is post esophagectomy and partial gastrectomy with gastric pull-through, has a complex right pleural collection containing air and fluid, which is consistent with a leak. The exact origin of the leak is not visualized, but the extraluminal contrast is seen at the level of the aortic arch. There are no pathological enlargements in the mediastinal lymph nodes. The airways are patent to the segmental levels bilaterally. There is a small left pleural effusion, but no pericardial effusion. The report also notes coronary artery calcifications and bibasilar atelectasis, with ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe.
