1. Fractured sternotomy wire noted. 2. Unchanged calcified granuloma below aspect of right hemidiaphragm. 3. Consolidation suggestive of pneumonia present.
unchanged pulmonary status with no acute intrathoracic process. Status post median sternotomy CABG with wires intact. Enlarged round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base unchanged. Increased opacity and fullness in the pleural space, possibly related to granulomatous disease. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.
evidence of possible calcified granulomatous disease in the right paratracheal and hilar regions, as well as the posterior right lung base, with stable conglomerate lymph nodes and no acute abnormalities identified.
persistent moderate enlargement of the heart with marked left pleural knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, streaky opacities minimally improved, and no evidence of pneumothorax or significant effusion. The percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes remain in standard position.
no acute cardiopulmonary process, but evidence of cardiomegaly and degenerative changes in the lungs and glenohumeral joints.
1 stable opacity in the retrocardiac region suggestive of effusion or possible aspiration 2 moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence and opacity suggestive of hemorrhage in the right lung base
minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base with atherosclerotic calcification and obscuration suggestive of edema. Mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and degenerative changes in the aortic arch. No evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax, but bibasilar markings and pulmonary vascular engorgement are present. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes are unchanged and positioned correctly.
stable with possible infection and atelectasis in the left lung base, with streaky opacities and mild congestion in the vascular and cardiomediastinal silhouette. No evidence of picc tip migration.
1 opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis in the bibasilar regions with possible hypertension and enlargement of the right pleural bulging 2 small effusion and edema slightly improved compared to prior exam
no significant interval change since the prior examination, with persistent right upper extremity calcification and a moderately enlarged arch without evidence of pneumothorax or significant pleural or mediastinal abnormalities. The PICC tip remains in appropriate position and there is no large effusion present. The left lower lobe opacity remains stable.
