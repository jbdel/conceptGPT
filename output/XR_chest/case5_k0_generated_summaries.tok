The radiology report shows that the lungs have low volume and there is no evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax. A 1-2 cm calcified granuloma below the medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior study. There are no pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. The inferior sternotomy wire is fractured but unchanged. Surgical clips and vascular markers in the thorax are related to prior CABG surgery. Overall, there is no evidence of pneumonia or focal airspace consolidation.
Stable findings of a round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease, an enlarged right hilar lymph node, and a right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate. No evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG with wires intact. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and the mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
The radiology report shows a stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouette with a possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence. There is a rounded calcified nodule in the region of the posterior right lung base, which is suggestive of a calcified granuloma likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease previously seen. The pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes are better seen on CT and there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is seen. Overall, the findings are suggestive of a possible calcified granuloma in the right lung base with lymph node involvement.
Moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob. Left PICC tip terminates in the distal left brachiocephalic vein. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with bibasilar streaky airspace opacities minimally improved. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. No pneumothorax identified. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube seen in the left upper quadrant. Tracheostomy tube in unchanged standard position.
The radiology report shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, but this could be due to positioning and low inspiratory effort. The lungs are clear of any large confluent consolidation. Calcifications are noted at the aortic arch and degenerative changes are noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Otherwise, the osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable.
There is a hazy opacity in the right lung which may represent aspiration or hemorrhage, and a retrocardiac opacity at the left base which is suggestive of effusion. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, and there is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization and enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with mild pulmonary edema. The tracheostomy tube is in place and there are no displaced rib fractures. Overall, there is possible aspiration or hemorrhage in the right lung and effusion in the left base, with mild pulmonary edema and stable cardiomegaly.
The bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest shows minimal interval change when compared to the prior study performed 24 hours ago. There is minimal stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours consistent with mild chronic heart failure. Persistent obscuration of the pulmonary vascular markings in the right lung base is consistent with trace pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is still present, but the lungs are otherwise clear with no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The left internal jugular central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and orogastric tube are unchanged and appropriately positioned. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are once again noted.
Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous and soft tissue structures. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis, with possible infection. Left picc tip is not clearly delineated on the current exam.
The radiology report suggests possible pulmonary arterial hypertension with bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries. There is also evidence of pulmonary edema, which has slightly improved compared to the prior study. The presence of bibasilar opacifications is suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation. A small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Overall, the findings indicate possible pulmonary hypertension and atelectasis/consolidation.
The radiology report shows no significant changes in the endotracheal tube, NG tube, and right upper extremity PICC with its tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or large pleural effusion. The left lower lobe opacity remains unchanged. The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged, and there is notable calcification of the aortic arch in the mediastinal contours.
