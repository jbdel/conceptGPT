consolidation suggestive of pneumonia with no evidence of pneumothorax or effusions. Fractured sternotomy wire and unchanged calcified granuloma noted.
unchanged postoperative status with stable granulomatous disease and an unchanged calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality identified.
stable appearance with possible calcified granulomatous disease, including a conglomerate lymph node and nodules suggestive of granulomas in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions. No acute intrathoracic process identified.
moderately enlarged heart with possible left pleural effusion and mild congestion. Streaky opacities minimally improved, possibly representing airspace disease. No evidence of pneumothorax. Calcification seen in the left upper quadrant. Percutaneous knob seen. Gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes unchanged in standard position. Further evaluation recommended.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with degenerative changes in the osseous structures and glenohumeral joints, no evidence of large confluent consolidation or significant pulmonary abnormalities.
moderate cardiomegaly with a slight prominence of the left base and a possible opacity suggestive of hemorrhage in the right lung. No displaced fractures or acute abnormalities are seen. The opacity in the retrocardiac region is unchanged and may represent an effusion, possibly related to aspiration. Mild pulmonary edema is also present. A chest CT is recommended for further evaluation.
mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and atelectasis at the right lung base, with no acute pulmonary or pleural process identified. Atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes noted in the aortic arch. No acute changes to the endotracheal or orogastric tubes.
stable appearance with possible left lung base atelectasis and opacities suggestive of infection, with no evidence of PICC tip complication or acute cardiopulmonary process. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is also noted.
possible pulmonary hypertension with opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis, and a small unchanged pleural effusion. Further evaluation is recommended.
no significant change in cardiopulmonary status with persistent right upper extremity calcification and moderately enlarged arch, endotracheal tube and NG tube in appropriate position, no large effusion or pneumothorax, and stable left lower lobe opacity.
