unchanged pulmonary volumes with low consolidation suggestive of pneumonia and unchanged calcified granuloma below the aspect of the right hemidiaphragm. No evidence of pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Fractured sternotomy wire noted.
stable postoperative changes with no evidence of acute intrathoracic process. The enlarged round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base is unchanged and likely represents a benign granuloma. No significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.
stable appearance with possible calcified granulomatous disease in the right lung base and hilar region.
1 moderately enlarged heart with mild congestion 2 left pleural effusion with possible airspace disease and streaky opacities minimally improved 3 calcified left upper quadrant knob likely representing a percutaneous gastrostomy tube 4 no evidence of pneumothorax or significant change in position of tracheostomy tube
cardiomegaly with degenerative changes in the osseous structures and no evidence of large confluent consolidation in the lungs.
stable cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and possible hemorrhage in the right lung, unchanged retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion, and a tracheostomy tube in place. No acute fractures or displaced rib fractures identified.
mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base, otherwise clear pulmonary exam with no acute findings. Atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes noted. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
stable chest with possible atelectasis and infection in the left lung base, with no evidence of PICC tip complications or acute abnormalities in the vascular or cardiomediastinal silhouette.
possible pulmonary hypertension with associated consolidation, atelectasis, and pleural effusion, as well as possible enlargement of the right lung and pulmonary arteries. Edema has slightly improved.
Unchanged findings in the right upper extremity and endotracheal tube. Moderately enlarged calcified arch and unchanged opacity in the left lower lobe. No evidence of pneumothorax or large effusion. The position of the PICC tip and NG tube appear appropriate. No significant changes in the pleural or mediastinal regions.
