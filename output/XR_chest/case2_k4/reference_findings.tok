no evidence of pneumonia or focal consolidation, unchanged pulmonary markers and no effusions, fractured sternotomy wire and calcified granuloma unchanged, no pneumothorax or pleural edema observed.
1 unchanged granulomatous disease with an enlarged calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base 2 increased pleural fullness without evidence of focal consolidation or effusion 3 stable post-sternotomy CABG status with intact wires.
Findings suggestive of possible calcified granulomatous disease, with stable nodules and lymph conglomerates in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions. No evidence of effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. Mediastinal silhouettes may show a slight decrease in prominence. Further evaluation may be warranted.
1 marked left pleural effusion with moderate enlargement of the heart and mild pulmonary congestion 2 streaky opacities suggestive of airspace disease with possible effusion in the left upper quadrant 3 no evidence of pneumothorax or significant change in the position of the percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes
enlarged cardiac silhouette and degenerative changes seen in the osseous structures, recommend further evaluation. No large confluent consolidation or significant abnormalities seen in the lungs or glenohumeral joints.
possible aspiration effusion with stable opacity in retrocardiac region, mild stable hazy opacity in left base, and possible hemorrhage in right lung. Enlarged vasculature and moderate cardiomegaly present. Tracheostomy tube in place. Further evaluation recommended.
mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base, with no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities otherwise. Atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes noted. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes unchanged and in good position.
left lower lobe atelectasis with possible underlying infection. The clinical team should be notified for further management.
findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension with bibasilar opacifications and bulging suggestive of enlargement, possible consolidation and atelectasis, and small unchanged effusion. Mild improvement in pulmonary arterial edema. Further evaluation recommended.
stable chest radiograph with no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
