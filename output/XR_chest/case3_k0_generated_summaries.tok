The patient's lungs appear to have normal volume with no effusions or edema present. However, there is consolidation suggestive of pneumonia and a calcified granuloma measuring 1-2 cm that remains unchanged. The surgical clips are also unchanged, but there is a fractured sternotomy wire. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural involvement. Vascular and airspace structures appear normal with no focal consolidation or signs of pneumonia. Overall, the patient's pulmonary status is low and requires further monitoring and treatment.
The pulmonary system appears normal with unchanged mediastinal contours. There is a conglomerate of wires intact, status post median sternotomy CABG. An enlarged, round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base remains unchanged. The right hilum and hilar contours appear granulomatous with an enlarged area in the right paratracheal region. There is no effusion or pneumothorax present. Increased opacity and pleural fullness are noted, but there is no focal consolidation. The cardiac silhouette size is within normal limits.
The chest radiograph shows stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with no evidence of effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. There is a possible slight decrease in prominence of the mediastinal silhouettes. A calcified nodule is present in the posterior right lung base, suggestive of a granuloma. There is also a conglomerate of lymph nodes in the right paratracheal region. The overall impression is of possible calcified granulomatous disease, with a nodule suggestive of granuloma in the right hilar region.
The patient's chest X-ray shows moderately enlarged left upper quadrant with streaky opacities minimally improved. There is possible effusion and mild congestion in the airspace. No pneumothorax is observed, but there are calcifications and marked left pleural knob. The pulmonary vascular and heart appear to be on the left side. The gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes remain in standard position and unchanged.
The cardiac silhouette appears normal, but there are signs of enlarged lungs. No large confluent consolidation is present, but there are calcifications and degenerative changes in the osseous structures. Additionally, there are findings of glenohumeral joint abnormalities. Further evaluation may be necessary to fully assess these findings.
The patient's pulmonary system shows some concerning findings, including opacity suggestive of effusion and possible aspiration effusion. There is also an opacity unchanged in the retrocardiac area. The pulmonary arteries appear enlarged, and there are no displaced fractures. The vasculature is also enlarged, and there is a tracheostomy tube in place. The left base shows a mild, stable haziness, and there is moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence. There is also an opacity suggestive of hemorrhage and possible hemorrhage in the right lung. Overall, further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the extent and cause of these findings.
The pulmonary exam revealed minimal stable enlargement in the right lung base, along with atherosclerotic calcification. There was also obscuration suggestive of edema, which may be related to mild chronic heart failure. The left internal jugular central venous line was in place, and there was no evidence of catheter-related complications. The cardiomediastinal contours were otherwise clear, with no evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. There were degenerative changes noted in the aortic arch, and pleural markings were present. The endotracheal tube and orogastric tube were unchanged and appropriately positioned. Bilateral glenohumeral joint exam was unremarkable. Overall, the pulmonary vascular exam was concerning for trace edema and atelectasis, but no significant abnormalities were noted.
The patient's chest X-ray shows stable streaky opacities in the left lung base, suggestive of atelectasis. There is no evidence of a PICC tip, but there is a possibility of infection. The vascular and cardiomediastinal silhouette appear normal, with mild congestion present. Overall, the findings suggest atelectasis with no significant changes since the previous imaging. Further evaluation and management may be necessary to address the possible infection.
The imaging findings suggest possible pulmonary hypertension with bulging suggestive of enlargement in the right pleural region. There are opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis in the bibasilar region, with possible consolidation. There is also a small effusion that remains unchanged. The pulmonary arterial system is involved, with opacifications seen in the pulmonary arteries. Edema is slightly improved. Further evaluation and management are recommended.
The imaging shows an unchanged right upper extremity with an endotracheal tube in place. There is a moderately enlarged arch with calcification present, but no evidence of pneumothorax. The picc tip is visible and there is no large effusion in the pleural or mediastinal regions. The left lower lobe shows no change in opacity.
