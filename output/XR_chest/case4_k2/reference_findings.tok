no acute cardiopulmonary process, stable calcified granuloma, and unchanged surgical clips and vascular markers related to prior CABG surgery.
unchanged round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease known enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate account for increased opacity and fullness in respective regions no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation cardiac silhouette and mediastinal and hilar contours are normal in size and unchanged from prior radiograph
1 stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence 2 calcified nodule in the region of the posterior right lung base likely representing a calcified granuloma secondary to prior granulomatous disease previously seen on CT 3 pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes better seen on CT without evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
moderately enlarged heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. No pneumothorax identified.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible accentuation by positioning and low inspiratory effort, no large confluent consolidation seen, calcifications noted at the aortic arch, degenerative changes noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally, otherwise unremarkable osseous and soft tissue structures.
Possible aspiration or pleural effusion in the right lung, unchanged retrocardiac opacity at the left base, stable moderate cardiomegaly, and mild pulmonary edema with enlarged pulmonary arteries. Tracheostomy tube in place and no displaced rib fractures. Follow-up imaging or further evaluation may be necessary to determine the cause of the hazy opacity in the right lung.
1 stable findings of mild chronic heart failure with persistent trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis 2 no acute changes in the lungs, pleural space, or catheter/tube positioning 3 chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are noted.
1 left picc tip is not clearly delineated on the current exam suggest further imaging or evaluation 2 mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis, possible infection cannot be excluded 3 stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous and soft tissue structures
possible pulmonary arterial hypertension with improvement in pulmonary edema, unchanged small right pleural effusion and bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation. Tracheostomy noted.
moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette with calcification of the aortic arch, no significant changes in endotracheal tube, NG tube, or PICC placement, and no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
