no evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema, unchanged calcified granuloma, no pleural effusions or pneumothorax, fractured sternotomy wire and surgical clips related to prior CABG surgery.
unchanged round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease, known enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate, no evidence of acute pulmonary pathology or pleural effusion/pneumothorax, and normal cardiac silhouette size.
stable cardiopulmonary status with possible prior granulomatous disease and lymph node involvement seen on CT evaluation. Calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base likely represents a calcified granuloma. No acute findings of pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.
Moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left pleural effusion has resolved and no pneumothorax is identified. Left PICC tip is seen terminating in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen in the left upper quadrant. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged standard position. Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are minimally improved.
cardiac silhouette is enlarged, likely accentuated by positioning and low inspiratory effort, with no evidence of large confluent consolidation. Calcifications noted at the aortic arch and degenerative changes noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Lungs are clear. No other significant abnormalities identified.
1. Hazy opacity in the right lung may represent aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage. Further evaluation is recommended. 2. Retrocardiac opacity at the left base is unchanged and suggestive of effusion. 3. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 4. Slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization and enlarged pulmonary arteries are consistent with mild pulmonary edema. 5. Tracheostomy tube is in place. 6. No displaced rib fractures are seen.
Stable chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes noted. Tubes appropriately positioned.
1 stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous/soft tissue structures 2 possible atelectasis with streaky opacities at lung bases, infection cannot be excluded 3 left picc tip not clearly delineated on current exam
stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension and possible atelectasis or consolidation. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
1 stable appearance of endotracheal tube, NG tube, and right upper extremity PICC with tip at cavoatrial junction 2 no significant changes in pulmonary or pleural findings 3 moderate cardiac enlargement and calcification of the aortic arch noted on mediastinal contours
