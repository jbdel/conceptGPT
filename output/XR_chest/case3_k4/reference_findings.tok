1 stable calcified granuloma 2 consolidation suggestive of pneumonia without evidence of frank pulmonary edema or effusion
unchanged findings with no acute cardiopulmonary process. Status post median sternotomy CABG with wires intact. Enlarged round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base and increased opacity in the right hilum suggestive of granulomatous disease. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.
evidence of possible calcified granulomatous disease with stable nodules in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions, and possible calcified granuloma in the right hilar region. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
mild improvement in airspace opacities with mild improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion since last exam, but left pleural effusion remains marked and unchanged. No acute findings otherwise.
cardiomegaly with degenerative changes, but no acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
1 stable opacity in the retrocardiac region suggestive of effusion or possible aspiration 2 mild cardiomegaly with slight prominence and opacity suggestive of possible hemorrhage in the right lung base
mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and stable bibasilar atelectasis. Atherosclerotic calcification is noted in the right lung base. No evidence of acute pulmonary pathology or pleural effusion.
stable atelectasis with possible superimposed infection, evidenced by streaky opacities at the left lung base. Mild congestion is also noted in the vascular and cardiomediastinal silhouette. No evidence of picc tip migration.
1 opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis in the bibasilar lungs, with possible enlargement of the right pleural bulging suggestive of pulmonary hypertension 2 small effusion unchanged, with slightly improved edema in the pulmonary arteries
no significant interval change since the prior examination, with persistent right upper extremity calcification and moderate enlargement of the arch. No evidence of pneumothorax or large effusion. The endotracheal tube and PICC tip remain in appropriate position. Mild opacity in the left lower lobe is unchanged.
