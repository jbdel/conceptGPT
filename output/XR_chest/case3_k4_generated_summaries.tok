unchanged pulmonary findings with stable surgical clips and calcified granuloma, but concern for possible pneumonia or consolidation in the lower lung fields.
1 no evidence of acute disease 2 stable granulomatous disease with an enlarged calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base unchanged from prior study 3 status post median sternotomy cabg with wires intact 4 increased opacity in the right paratracheal region may represent lymphadenopathy or vascular congestion correlation with clinical findings is suggested
stable calcified granulomatous disease with no evidence of active infection or malignancy. Possible slight decrease in prominence of mediastinal silhouettes. Recommend follow-up imaging to monitor stability of nodules.
moderately enlarged heart with calcification and marked left pleural knob, streaky opacities minimally improved, and possible effusion in the left upper quadrant. No pneumothorax was observed, and the tracheostomy tube remained in standard position. The pulmonary vascular and bibasilar airspace were also evaluated, and mild congestion was noted. The picc tip was assessed, and the gastrostomy tube was unchanged.
enlarged cardiac silhouette and lungs with degenerative changes and calcifications in the osseous structures, without evidence of large confluent consolidation in the lungs. Additionally, there are calcifications and degenerative changes noted in the glenohumeral joints.
1 stable retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion, possible aspiration 2 mild cardiomegaly with slight prominence of pulmonary vasculature 3 hazy opacity in left base concerning for edema or possible hemorrhage, further evaluation recommended
minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base with obscuration suggestive of edema and mild chronic heart failure. No evidence of acute abnormalities such as atelectasis, effusion, or pneumothorax. Atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes noted in the aortic arch. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes unchanged in position. Follow-up imaging recommended to monitor for any changes.
stable left lung streaky opacities likely represent atelectasis with possible underlying infection, mild pulmonary congestion, and no evidence of picc line complications.
1 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis, with possible enlargement of the right pleural bulging suggestive of hypertension 2 small effusion unchanged, with slightly improved edema 3 further evaluation with additional imaging recommended to assess for possible consolidation and atelectasis in the pulmonary arteries.
stable findings with no significant changes, including no evidence of pneumothorax or large effusion, and stable opacity in the left lower lobe. The endotracheal tube remains in place and there is moderate enlargement and calcification of the arch. The picc tip and pleural and mediastinal contours are also unchanged, as is the NG tube.
