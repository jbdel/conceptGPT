suggestive of pneumonia with consolidation, but no acute intrathoracic process otherwise. Fractured sternotomy wire noted. Calcified granuloma unchanged. Follow-up recommended to monitor for resolution of pneumonia and stability of other findings.
stable postoperative changes with no acute pulmonary pathology identified. Calcified nodule and granulomatous changes noted, likely representing prior granulomatous infection. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. Follow-up imaging recommended to monitor stability of pulmonary nodules.
1 stable conglomerate of calcified nodules in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions, suggestive of granulomatous disease, with no evidence of new or focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. 2 Possible slight decrease in prominence of mediastinal silhouettes, with a stable calcified nodule in the right hilar region also suggestive of granuloma. Further evaluation may be warranted to confirm the presence and extent of calcified granulomatous disease.
There is marked left pleural calcification with mild congestion and no pneumothorax. The percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes are unchanged in their standard position. There are streaky opacities in the airspace of the left upper quadrant, which have minimally improved. There is also a knob-like structure in the heart. The pulmonary vascular congestion is bibasilar, and there is a moderately enlarged picc tip.
findings suggestive of chronic cardiopulmonary disease with degenerative changes in the osseous structures and glenohumeral joints. No evidence of large confluent consolidation. Further evaluation may be warranted.
1 stable opacity in the retrocardiac region suggestive of possible aspiration effusion or hemorrhage 2 enlarged pulmonary vasculature with mild cardiomegaly and slight prominence 3 moderate opacity in the left base with possible edema or hemorrhage. No displaced rib fractures seen.
mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base, with atherosclerotic calcification and obscuration suggestive of edema. No evidence of acute pulmonary pathology or pneumothorax, and endotracheal and orogastric tubes remain unchanged and properly positioned. Degenerative changes noted in the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint.
Stable findings with no significant change in the lung parenchyma. Streaky opacities and mild congestion are suggestive of atelectasis and possible infection. No evidence of a PICC tip. Further evaluation may be necessary.
1 unchanged bulging suggestive of pulmonary hypertension with possible consolidation and enlargement in the right pleural area 2 opacifications suggestive of atelectasis and small effusion unchanged in the bibasilar region
there is no significant change in the findings from the prior examination, with the right upper extremity and endotracheal tube remaining unchanged. There is moderate enlargement and calcification of the arch, but no evidence of pneumothorax. The picc tip and pleural and mediastinal areas show no significant changes, and there is no large effusion in the left lower lobe. Overall, there is no significant change in opacity.
