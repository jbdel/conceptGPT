The lungs show no signs of pneumonia, pleural effusions, or pulmonary edema. A calcified granuloma is present below the medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm, which is unchanged from prior studies. The inferior sternotomy wire is fractured but unchanged. Surgical clips and vascular markers in the thorax are related to prior CABG surgery.
Stable round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate noted. No evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. Cardiac silhouette normal in size. No significant changes from previous radiographs.
1. Calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease. 2. Pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes seen on CT. 3. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 4. Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
1. Left PICC tip terminates in the distal left brachiocephalic vein. 2. Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. 3. Moderate enlargement of the heart. 4. Marked calcification of the aortic knob. 5. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 6. Minimally improved bibasilar streaky airspace opacities. 7. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. 8. No pneumothorax identified. 9. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube seen in the left upper quadrant.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible accentuation due to positioning and low inspiratory effort. Clear lungs without large consolidation. Calcifications at the aortic arch and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Otherwise, unremarkable osseous and soft tissue structures.
There is a hazy opacity in the right lung that may indicate aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage. The retrocardiac opacity at the left base is unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. There is slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization and enlarged pulmonary arteries, which is consistent with mild pulmonary edema. The tracheostomy tube is in place, and there are no displaced rib fractures.
Stable mild chronic heart failure with persistent trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes. Central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and orogastric tube are appropriately positioned.
The chest x-ray shows mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis. The left picc tip is not clearly delineated on the current exam. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable and there are no changes in the osseous and soft tissue structures. Infection cannot be excluded.
The patient has a tracheostomy and there is no significant change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette. The pulmonary outflow tract is enlarged, indicating underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. There is slight improvement in pulmonary edema compared to the prior study. There is a small right pleural effusion that remains unchanged. Bibasilar opacifications suggest atelectasis or consolidation.
Stable endotracheal tube and right upper extremity PICC with tip at cavoatrial junction. No change in left lower lobe opacity, no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette and notable calcification of the aortic arch in mediastinal contours.
