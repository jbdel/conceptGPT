low lung volume with no acute intrathoracic process, stable calcified granuloma, and unchanged surgical findings related to prior CABG surgery.
unchanged calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease, enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate unchanged from prior imaging, no acute intrathoracic process identified.
calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease, pretracheal and right hilar lymph node conglomerates seen on ct, stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
1 moderate cardiac enlargement with marked aortic calcification 2 mild pulmonary vascular congestion with bibasilar airspace opacities 3 resolution of left pleural effusion 4 percutaneous gastrostomy tube in left upper quadrant
mild cardiomegaly and calcifications at the aortic arch, no acute pulmonary process identified.
right lung opacity, stable retrocardiac opacity, moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and tracheostomy tube in place. No displaced rib fractures.
stable mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, no acute findings.
stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis at the lung bases, possibility of infection cannot be excluded. Left picc tip not clearly delineated.
1 stable tracheostomy and cardiomediastinal silhouette 2 enlargement of pulmonary arteries and possible pulmonary arterial hypertension 3 slight improvement in pulmonary edema 4 unchanged small right pleural effusion 5 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation
1 unchanged position of support devices 2 no significant change in lung opacities or pleural effusion/pneumothorax 3 moderate cardiac enlargement and calcification of the aortic arch in the mediastinum
