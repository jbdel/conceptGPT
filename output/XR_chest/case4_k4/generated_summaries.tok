unchanged calcified granuloma and surgical clips related to prior cabg surgery, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process
unchanged round calcified pulmonary nodule consistent with prior granulomatous disease, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
1 calcified nodule in the region of the posterior right lung base likely represents a calcified granuloma secondary to prior granulomatous disease 2 pretracheal and right hilar lymph nodes are better seen on ct evaluation 3 no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process
moderately enlarged heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left PICC tip seen terminating in the distal left brachiocephalic vein. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. No pneumothorax identified. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube seen in the left upper quadrant.
cardiomegaly with possible positional accentuation, no significant pulmonary pathology identified, degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints and calcifications at the aortic arch noted.
Moderate cardiomegaly with stable retrocardiac opacity at the left base and hazy opacity in the right lung, which may represent aspiration, effusion, or hemorrhage. Enlarged pulmonary arteries and slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature are consistent with mild pulmonary edema. No displaced rib fractures are seen. Tracheostomy tube is in place. Further evaluation is recommended to determine the cause of the hazy opacity in the right lung.

mild pulmonary vascular congestion and possible atelectasis with concern for infection, left picc tip not clearly delineated on current exam.
1 pulmonary arterial hypertension with enlargement of pulmonary arteries 2 improvement in pulmonary edema 3 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation
moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette with calcification of the aortic arch, no acute pulmonary abnormality identified.
