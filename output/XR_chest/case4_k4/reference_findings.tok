unchanged round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease, known enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate account for increased opacity and fullness respectively, no acute findings.
Stable cardiopulmonary status with a calcified nodule in the region of the posterior right lung base suggestive of prior granulomatous disease. Pretracheal and right hilar lymph nodes are better evaluated on CT. No acute intrathoracic process is seen.
moderately enlarged heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved, no evidence of pneumothorax, and presence of percutaneous gastrostomy tube in the left upper quadrant.
1 enlarged cardiac silhouette, possibly positional or due to low inspiratory effort 2 calcifications at the aortic arch 3 degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints


1 stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous/soft tissue structures 2 mild pulmonary vascular congestion with streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis, though infection cannot be excluded 3 left picc tip not clearly delineated on current exam
stable tracheostomy noted with unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette and small right pleural effusion. Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension with bibasilar opacifications likely reflecting atelectasis or consolidation.
stable appearance with no acute cardiopulmonary process, notable for calcification of the aortic arch.
