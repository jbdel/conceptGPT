no acute cardiopulmonary process, unchanged calcified granuloma, and fractured inferior sternotomy wire related to prior cabg surgery.
1 unchanged calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease 2 enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes without evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality
stable calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, no acute cardiopulmonary process, possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence. Clinical correlation advised for pretracheal and right hilar lymph nodes.
moderately enlarged heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, and resolved left pleural effusion. No acute intrathoracic process identified.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible accentuation by positioning and low inspiratory effort, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. No evidence of large consolidation in the lungs.
right lung hazy opacity, left retrocardiac opacity unchanged, stable moderate cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, tracheostomy tube in place, no displaced rib fractures.
stable cardiomegaly with mild chronic heart failure and trace pulmonary edema bibasilar atelectasis and clear lungs no pneumothorax or pleural effusion unchanged positioning of central venous catheter endotracheal tube and orogastric tube chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in bilateral glenohumeral joints.
1. Comparison to previous exam shows stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous/soft tissue structures.  2. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis seen, but infection cannot be excluded.  3. Left PICC tip not clearly delineated.  4. Clinical correlation recommended.
1 tracheostomy noted 2 enlargement of pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3 slight improvement in pulmonary edema compared to prior study 4 unchanged small right pleural effusion 5 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation
stable endotracheal tube and lines, no significant changes in lung opacity or pleural effusion, moderate cardiac enlargement with aortic arch calcification.
