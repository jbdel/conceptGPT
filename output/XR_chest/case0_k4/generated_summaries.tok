low lung volume without acute intrathoracic process, unchanged calcified granuloma, and prior surgical findings including fractured sternotomy wire and clips/markers related to prior cabg surgery.
unchanged round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease, enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate, no pleural effusion or pneumothorax, normal cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours.
stable cardiopulmonary status with a calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base and lymph node conglomerate in the pretracheal and right hilar regions.
1 moderately enlarged heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob 2 mild pulmonary vascular congestion with bibasilar streaky airspace opacities minimally improved 3 resolution of previously noted left pleural effusion 4 no pneumothorax identified 5 appropriately positioned left picc tip and tracheostomy tube 6 percutaneous gastrostomy tube seen in left upper quadrant.
1 no evidence of large confluent consolidation in the lungs 2 cardiac silhouette appears enlarged but may be positional or due to low inspiratory effort 3 calcifications at the aortic arch and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally
1 hazy opacity in the right lung possibly representing aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage 2 retrocardiac opacity at the left base unchanged 3 moderate cardiomegaly stable 4 mild pulmonary edema with slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and enlarged pulmonary arteries 5 no displaced rib fractures
stable chest radiograph with chronic findings of mild chronic heart failure, trace pulmonary edema, and bibasilar atelectasis. No acute intrathoracic process identified.
stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with possible atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but infection cannot be excluded. Left picc tip not clearly delineated. Comparison to previous exam recommended.
pulmonary arterial hypertension with improved pulmonary edema, unchanged pleural effusion and bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
1 stable position of endotracheal tube, ng tube, and picc line 2 no acute cardiopulmonary process 3 calcification of the aortic arch
