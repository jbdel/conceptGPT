evidence of pneumonia with consolidation in the lower lungs, but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality otherwise. Recommend follow-up imaging to monitor the fractured sternotomy wire and calcified granuloma.
unchanged pulmonary and mediastinal contours with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Status post median sternotomy CABG with an enlarged, round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base that is unchanged. No effusion or pneumothorax present. Increased opacity and fullness in the right paratracheal region with granulomatous appearance. These findings were discussed with the patient's physician.
stable appearance of calcified granulomatous disease with no evidence of acute pulmonary process or effusion. Possible slight decrease in mediastinal lymph node prominence.
persistent left pleural effusion with mild congestion and possible calcification, minimally improved streaky opacities in the airspace, and no acute pneumothorax or significant changes in the position of support devices. Further evaluation may be necessary to assess the efficacy of percutaneous interventions.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with no evidence of large confluent consolidation or significant osseous abnormalities. Degenerative changes and calcifications noted in the glenohumeral joints.
1. Possible aspiration effusion with retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion 2. Enlarged vasculature and mild hazy opacity at the left base 3. Moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence 4. Opacity suggestive of hemorrhage in the right lung 5. No displaced fractures or pneumothorax 6. Tracheostomy tube in place 7. Overall stable with possible hemorrhage and edema in the right lung.
mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base, with atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in the aortic arch. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities are noted, and the endotracheal and orogastric tubes are unchanged in position.
stable findings with possible atelectasis and mild congestion, consideration for further evaluation for possible infection.
possible pulmonary hypertension with opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis, small unchanged pleural effusion, and possible enlargement of the right pleural bulging. Follow-up recommended.
no significant change in the right upper extremity calcification or the left lower lobe opacity, endotracheal tube and NG tube in place, no evidence of pneumothorax or large effusion, picc tip in appropriate position, and moderately enlarged arch with no acute abnormalities in the pleural or mediastinal contours.
