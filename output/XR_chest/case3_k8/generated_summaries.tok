acute pneumonia in the right lower lobe with no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.


persistent moderate cardiomegaly with marked left pleural knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with minimally improved streaky opacities likely representing persistent infection or atelectasis. No acute findings otherwise.
cardiomegaly and degenerative changes, but no definite acute cardiopulmonary process

minimal stable enlargement at the right lung base with mild chronic heart failure and trace pulmonary edema. No evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax. Atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes noted in the aortic arch. Follow-up recommended for further evaluation of the pulmonary markings.

1 unchanged small effusion and mild pulmonary edema with interval improvement in opacifications suggestive of atelectasis 2 bulging of the pulmonary arteries suggestive of pulmonary hypertension and possible enlargement 3 possible consolidation in the right pleural space
no significant interval change since the prior examination given the differences in technique
