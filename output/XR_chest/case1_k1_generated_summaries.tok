stable chest radiograph with no acute intrathoracic process, unchanged calcified granuloma, and surgical clips and markers related to prior CABG surgery.
Stable calcified pulmonary nodule and lymph node conglomerates, no acute intrathoracic process.
Calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax seen. Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
1 moderate cardiomegaly with marked aortic calcification 2 mild pulmonary vascular congestion and bibasilar airspace opacities, likely representing pulmonary edema 3 resolution of previously noted left pleural effusion 4 appropriate placement of left picc and tracheostomy tube 5 presence of percutaneous gastrostomy tube in left upper quadrant
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible positioning and inspiratory effort artifact, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints. No evidence of large confluent consolidation or other acute cardiopulmonary process.
right lung opacity with possible aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage, stable retrocardiac opacity, moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema, and no displaced rib fractures.
stable mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, no acute findings. Chronic atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes noted.
Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis at the lung bases, with no clear evidence of infection. No significant changes in the cardiomediastinal silhouette or other structures.
1. Tracheostomy noted 2. Enlargement of pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3. Pulmonary edema slightly improved compared to prior study 4. Unchanged small right pleural effusion 5. Bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation
unchanged endotracheal tube, ng tube, and picc placement with no significant changes in lung opacities or pleural effusion/pneumothorax. Moderate cardiac enlargement and calcification of the aortic arch noted in mediastinal contours.
