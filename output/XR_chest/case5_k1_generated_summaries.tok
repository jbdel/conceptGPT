stable chronic changes with no acute intrathoracic process identified.
Stable appearance of a round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease, with no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. Enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes are unchanged and likely account for increased opacity and fullness in the right hilum and paratracheal region, respectively. The patient's cardiac silhouette is normal in size and there is no evidence of wire displacement following prior median sternotomy and CABG.
Calcified nodule in the region of the posterior right lung base likely represents calcified granuloma secondary to prior granulomatous disease. Pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes are stable. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with a possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
Moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. No evidence of pneumothorax. Left PICC tip terminates in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen in the left upper quadrant. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged standard position. Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are minimally improved.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible positional accentuation, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. No evidence of large confluent consolidation in the lungs.
1. Presence of a hazy opacity in the right lung, which may represent aspiration, effusion, or hemorrhage. Further imaging may be necessary to determine the cause. 2. Unchanged retrocardiac opacity at the left base, suggestive of effusion. 3. Moderate cardiomegaly, stable from previous imaging. 4. Mild pulmonary edema, consistent with slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and enlarged pulmonary arteries. 5. Tracheostomy tube in place, with no displaced rib fractures noted.
1 mild chronic heart failure with stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours 2 persistent trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis 3 chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes
Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis, with possible underlying infection. Left picc tip not clearly delineated on current exam.
1. Findings consistent with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension, including bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract and possible hypertension.  2. Slight improvement in pulmonary edema compared to prior study.  3. Unchanged small right pleural effusion.  4. Bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
1. Unchanged position of endotracheal tube, ng tube, and right upper extremity picc with its tip at the cavoatrial junction. 2. No significant changes in left lower lobe opacity or presence of large pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 3. Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette. 4. Notable calcification of the aortic arch in the mediastinal contours.
