stable post-surgical changes with no acute cardiopulmonary process, but consolidation suggestive of pneumonia warrants further evaluation.
unchanged pulmonary status with no evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. Status post median sternotomy CABG with wires intact. Enlarged round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base remains unchanged. No evidence of focal consolidation or granulomatous disease. Increased opacity and pleural fullness noted in the right paratracheal region.
Stable appearance with no evidence of acute disease. Possible calcified granulomatous disease with nodules suggestive of granulomas in the right hilar and posterior right lung base. No evidence of effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. Mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes are stable with possible slight decrease in prominence. Right paratracheal and pleural lymph nodes are conglomerate and may be suggestive of calcified granulomatous disease.
Moderate enlargement of the heart with marked left pleural effusion and bibasilar airspace disease. Streaky opacities in the left upper quadrant with possible calcification. Percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes in standard position with no significant change. No evidence of pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion.
chest radiograph demonstrates an enlarged cardiac silhouette and degenerative changes in the osseous structures, but no evidence of large confluent consolidations or significant abnormalities in the lungs or glenohumeral joints. Further evaluation may be warranted to assess for potential cardiac or musculoskeletal issues.
opacity in the retrocardiac region suggestive of effusion or possible aspiration, recommend further evaluation with chest CT and consideration of thoracentesis or bronchoscopy. Mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema also noted, likely related to underlying cardiovascular disease. Follow-up imaging recommended to monitor for any changes.
1 mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and atelectasis at the right lung base, possibly related to atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in the aortic arch 2 no acute cardiopulmonary process identified, with no evidence of effusion, pneumothorax, or endotracheal tube displacement 3 orogastric tube and left internal jugular central venous catheter unchanged and in appropriate position.
stable atelectasis with possible infection in the left lung base
possible pulmonary hypertension with areas of consolidation and atelectasis, and a small unchanged pleural effusion. Follow-up imaging recommended.
unchanged moderate right upper lobe calcified granuloma, stable endotracheal tube and PICC tip positions, no evidence of pneumothorax or large effusion, mild left lower lobe opacity likely related to atelectasis or mild pneumonia.
