1 unchanged calcified granuloma below the medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm 2 no evidence of pneumonia or focal airspace consolidation 3 unchanged surgical clips and vascular markers related to prior cabg surgery 4 fractured inferior sternotomy wire
unchanged appearance of prior granulomatous disease with a round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base, enlarged right hilar lymph node, and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
1 calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease previously seen on ct 2 stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence 3 no acute cardiopulmonary process
1 mild pulmonary vascular congestion with bibasilar streaky airspace opacities minimally improved 2 previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved 3 marked calcification of the aortic knob is again present
cardiomegaly with possible positional and inspiratory artifact, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints. No definite acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
1 hazy opacity in the right lung may represent aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage 2 moderate cardiomegaly is stable 3 slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization and enlarged pulmonary arteries are consistent with mild pulmonary edema
persistent bibasilar atelectasis and trace pulmonary edema consistent with mild chronic heart failure, unchanged central venous and airway tubes, stable chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joints.
mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis, with possible infection. Left picc tip not clearly delineated. No significant change in the cardiomediastinal silhouette or osseous and soft tissue structures.
1 unchanged tracheostomy and cardiomediastinal silhouette 2 bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3 slight improvement in pulmonary edema 4 unchanged small right pleural effusion 5 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation
no significant interval change since the prior examination, with notable calcification of the aortic arch and no evidence of significant pulmonary or pleural abnormalities.
