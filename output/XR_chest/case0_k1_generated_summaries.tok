stable chest radiograph with no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusions. Unchanged calcified granuloma and surgical markers related to prior CABG surgery. Fractured inferior sternotomy wire.
1. Unchanged round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease. 2. Enlarged right hilar lymph node seen on CT likely accounts for increased opacity at right hilum. 3. Right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate accounts for fullness at right paratracheal region. 4. No evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. 5. Normal cardiac silhouette and unchanged mediastinal and hilar contours.
1. Calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease. 2. Pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes are better seen on CT. 3. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 4. Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
Moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left PICC tip is seen terminating in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein. Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged standard position. Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are minimally improved. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. No pneumothorax is identified. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen in the left upper quadrant.
enlarged cardiac silhouette, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
1. Right lung hazy opacity, possibly aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage. 2. Unchanged retrocardiac opacity at the left base. 3. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. 4. Mild pulmonary edema with slight prominence of pulmonary vasculature and enlarged pulmonary arteries. 5. Tracheostomy tube in place. 6. No displaced rib fractures.
Stable mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. No acute findings of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes.
Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous/soft tissue structures. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis seen, but infection cannot be ruled out. Left PICC tip not clearly seen on current exam.
stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with no acute cardiopulmonary disease. Enlargement of pulmonary arteries and bibasilar opacifications suggest underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension and atelectasis/consolidation. Slight improvement in pulmonary edema. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
stable examination with notable calcification of the aortic arch.
