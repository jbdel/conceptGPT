no acute pulmonary abnormality, stable calcified granuloma, and unchanged surgical findings related to prior CABG surgery.
1 stable calcified pulmonary nodule consistent with prior granulomatous disease 2 enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes 3 no acute cardiopulmonary process identified
Calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes, and lymph node conglomerates in the pretracheal and right hilar regions. No evidence of acute pulmonary process or pleural effusion.
Moderate heart enlargement with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Improvement in bibasilar streaky airspace opacities and resolution of previously noted left pleural effusion. No pneumothorax identified. Placement of left PICC tip and tracheostomy tube unchanged. Presence of percutaneous gastrostomy tube in left upper quadrant.
enlarged cardiac silhouette and calcifications at the aortic arch suggest possible cardiovascular disease. Follow-up imaging and evaluation recommended. Degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints may require further assessment and management.
Right lung hazy opacity, retrocardiac opacity at left base unchanged, moderate cardiomegaly stable, mild pulmonary edema, tracheostomy tube in place, no displaced rib fractures. Further evaluation and management recommended.
stable cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema with persistent atelectasis and chronic degenerative changes in the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joints.
1 mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis, possibility of infection 2 left picc tip not clearly delineated 3 stable cardiomediastinal silhouette, osseous and soft tissue structures.
1. Tracheostomy noted 2. Enlargement of pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3. Improved pulmonary edema compared to prior study 4. Unchanged small right pleural effusion 5. Bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
unchanged endotracheal tube, NG tube, and PICC placement. No significant changes in lung opacity or pleural effusion/pneumothorax. Moderate cardiac enlargement with calcification of the aortic arch.
