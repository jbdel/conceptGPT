low lung volume, no pneumonia, unchanged calcified granuloma, no pleural effusions or pulmonary edema, fractured sternotomy wire, surgical clips and vascular markers related to prior cabg surgery.
Stable calcified pulmonary nodule consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
Calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, pretracheal lymph node conglomerate, and right hilar lymph nodes seen. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No acute pulmonary process identified. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible accentuation due to positioning and low inspiratory effort, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
Right lung hazy opacity, possible aspiration, pleural effusion or hemorrhage. Left base retrocardiac opacity unchanged. Moderate cardiomegaly stable. Mild pulmonary edema. No displaced rib fractures. Tracheostomy tube in place. Further evaluation recommended.
Stable mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. No acute changes. Chronic atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes noted.
Possible atelectasis and pulmonary vascular congestion, but cannot exclude infection. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous/soft tissue structures. Follow-up recommended.
1. Enlargement of pulmonary arteries and bulging of pulmonary outflow tract suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  2. Slight improvement in pulmonary edema compared to prior study.  3. Unchanged small right pleural effusion.  4. Bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.  5. Tracheostomy noted.
unchanged endotracheal tube, NG tube, and right upper extremity PICC with tip at cavoatrial junction. No acute pulmonary abnormalities. Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette with calcification of the aortic arch. No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
