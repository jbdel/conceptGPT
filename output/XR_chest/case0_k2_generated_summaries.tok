low lung volume, no pneumonia, unchanged calcified granuloma, no pleural effusions or pneumothorax, fractured sternotomy wire, surgical clips and vascular markers related to prior cabg surgery.
unchanged calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease, enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate, no evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation, normal cardiac silhouette and mediastinal/hilar contours.
1. Calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease. 2. Pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes are better seen on CT. 3. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax seen. 4. Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
moderately enlarged heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, minimal improvement in bibasilar airspace opacities, resolved left pleural effusion, and presence of percutaneous gastrostomy tube.
cardiomegaly with possible accentuation by positioning and low inspiratory effort, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. No evidence of large confluent consolidation in the lungs.
1. Hazy opacity in the right lung, possibly aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage. 2. Unchanged retrocardiac opacity at the left base. 3. Moderate cardiomegaly and slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization and enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with mild pulmonary edema.
stable findings of mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, no acute abnormalities identified.
left picc tip not clearly delineated mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis at lung bases, possibility of infection cannot be excluded. No acute intrathoracic process otherwise.
evidence of pulmonary arterial hypertension with improved pulmonary edema, unchanged pleural effusion and atelectasis/consolidation in the lungs.
stable examination with known chronic findings of aortic arch calcification and presence of medical devices in place.
