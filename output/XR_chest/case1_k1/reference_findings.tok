no acute intrathoracic process, stable calcified granuloma, and fractured sternotomy wire.
Stable calcified pulmonary nodule and lymph node conglomerate, consistent with prior granulomatous disease. No acute intrathoracic process identified.
1 calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease previously seen 2 stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence 3 pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes better seen on ct, no focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax identified.
Moderate enlargement of the heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Improvement in previously noted left pleural effusion and minimal improvement in bibasilar streaky airspace opacities. Presence of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube in the left upper quadrant. No pneumothorax identified.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible aortic arch calcifications and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. No evidence of acute pulmonary process.
1. Possible aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage in the right lung. 2. Mild pulmonary edema. 3. Stable moderate cardiomegaly.
stable mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. No acute findings of pneumonia or pneumothorax. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes.
stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with possible atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, left picc tip not clearly seen. Further evaluation may be needed to rule out infection.
1 tracheostomy noted 2 enlargement of pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3 slight improvement in pulmonary edema compared to prior study 4 unchanged small right pleural effusion 5 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
stable findings with no significant interval change, with notable calcification of the aortic arch in the mediastinal contours.
