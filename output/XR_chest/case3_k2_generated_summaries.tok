unchanged post-surgical changes with new consolidation suggestive of pneumonia, possible calcified granuloma unchanged. No evidence of pneumothorax or effusions.
unchanged pulmonary status post median sternotomy CABG with a conglomerate of granulomatous calcified nodules in the posterior right lung base and an enlarged round calcified nodule in the right hilum. No evidence of acute findings or focal consolidation. Increased opacity in the right paratracheal region and pleural fullness may reflect chronic changes. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.
Stable conglomerate of calcified nodules in the right hilar and posterior lung base regions, suggestive of granulomatous disease. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes are normal, with possible slight decrease in prominence of the right paratracheal lymph node. Nodule in the right lung base is suggestive of a calcified granuloma. Further evaluation of lymph nodes may be warranted.
Moderate enlargement of the heart with calcification and marked left pleural knob. Streaky opacities minimally improved, possibly due to an effusion in the left upper quadrant. No evidence of pneumothorax. Percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes unchanged in standard positions. Mild congestion noted in the bibasilar pulmonary vascular. The PICC tip was also noted.
no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, but there are degenerative changes in the osseous structures and glenohumeral joints.
1 stable pulmonary opacities, with no evidence of displaced fractures or significant change in retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion. 2 Mild cardiomegaly with slight prominence and moderate edema in the right lung, with possible hemorrhage. 3 Tracheostomy tube in place and enlarged vasculature, with hazy opacity in the left base suggestive of possible aspiration effusion. Further evaluation may be necessary to assess for atypical organisms.
1 mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and atelectasis at the right lung base, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary disease 2 atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in the aortic arch, otherwise unremarkable chest radiograph
Stable streaky opacities in the left lung base suggestive of atelectasis with possible underlying infection. No evidence of a PICC tip in the left lung. Mild vascular congestion noted in the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
1 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis, with possible underlying hypertension and enlargement 2 unchanged bulging in the pulmonary arteries and right pleural area 3 small effusion remains unchanged 4 slight improvement in edema 5 further evaluation may be necessary to determine the cause of the opacifications and bulging.
unchanged findings with no evidence of significant pathology or acute changes.
