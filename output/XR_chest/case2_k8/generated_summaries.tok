evidence of pneumonia in the lower lung fields with a fractured sternotomy wire and unchanged calcified granuloma. No signs of pneumothorax or effusion.
unchanged postoperative status with a granulomatous nodule in the posterior right lung base and an enlarged calcified nodule in the right hilum, unchanged from prior imaging. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
stable calcified granulomatous disease with possible granuloma in the right lung base and right hilar region
1 moderate left pleural effusion with associated airspace disease and mild pulmonary congestion 2 calcified left upper quadrant knob likely representing a percutaneous gastrostomy tube 3 no acute cardiopulmonary process identified 4 unchanged position of tracheostomy tube
enlarged cardiac silhouette and osseous changes with degenerative changes and calcifications, but no large confluent consolidations in the lungs. Evaluation of the glenohumeral joints may be warranted.
moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and possible hemorrhage in the right lung, as well as a retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion. The pulmonary vasculature appears enlarged and there is a tracheostomy tube in place. No displaced fractures are seen, but there is a slight prominence of the left base opacity suggestive of hemorrhage. The cephalization of the pulmonary vessels may indicate possible aspiration effusion. Overall, the opacity is unchanged and stable.
minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base with obscuration suggestive of edema and mild chronic heart failure. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Trace edema and degenerative changes noted.
stable appearance with possible atelectasis and mild congestion, recommend follow-up imaging to evaluate for possible infection.
findings concerning for bibasilar atelectasis or consolidation with possible underlying pulmonary hypertension and small pleural effusion, with improvement in pulmonary edema but persistent enlargement of the right heart and bulging of the pulmonary arteries.
unchanged right upper extremity calcification and position of the endotracheal tube, no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process, stable pleural and mediastinal findings, no large effusion, and no change in the opacity of the left lower lobe.
