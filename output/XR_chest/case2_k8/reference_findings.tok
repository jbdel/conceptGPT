fractured sternotomy wire with consolidation suggestive of pneumonia, unchanged calcified granuloma, and no acute cardiopulmonary process otherwise.
unchanged postoperative status with stable calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base and increased opacity in the right paratracheal region, likely representing pleural fullness. No evidence of acute pulmonary process.
stable appearance of calcified granulomatous disease with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process. Follow-up imaging may be warranted to monitor any changes in the size or appearance of the nodules.
findings consistent with left-sided heart failure and possible pneumonia with minimal improvement on imaging. Left pleural effusion and calcification noted. No acute pneumothorax or other significant abnormalities.
1 enlarged cardiac silhouette and degenerative changes in the osseous structures 2 no evidence of large confluent consolidation in the lungs
1 stable retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion or possible aspiration 2 mild left lower lobe hazy opacity with tracheostomy tube in place 3 moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence of the right heart border and opacity suggestive of hemorrhage in the right lung 4 no evidence of displaced rib fractures or acute cardiopulmonary process
1 mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and atelectasis 2 atherosclerotic calcifications in the right lung base with minimal stable enlargement 3 no acute intrathoracic process identified
stable atelectasis with possible underlying infection, mild congestion in the cardiomediastinal silhouette and lung bases. No acute findings related to the PICC tip.
persistent opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis, with bulging suggestive of pulmonary hypertension and possible enlargement of the right pleural space. Small effusion unchanged and edema slightly improved. Further evaluation and follow-up recommended.
unchanged chest radiographic findings with no evidence of pneumothorax or significant interval change in the position of the endotracheal tube, PICC tip, or NG tube. There is a moderately enlarged calcified arch and no large effusion in the pleural or mediastinal regions. The opacity in the left lower lobe remains unchanged.
