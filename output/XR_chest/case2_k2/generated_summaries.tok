1. Unchanged surgical clips and markers, with a fractured sternotomy wire 2. No evidence of pulmonary edema or effusions 3. Consolidation suggestive of pneumonia, but no focal consolidation seen 4. Unchanged calcified granuloma below the aspect of the right hemidiaphragm 5. No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion 6. Vascular and airspace volumes in the lungs are unchanged.
unchanged pulmonary status post median sternotomy CABG with an enlarged, round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base. No evidence of infection or effusion. Recommend follow-up imaging to monitor for any changes in the nodule.
stable appearance with possible calcified granulomatous disease and nodules suggestive of granuloma in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax.
moderately enlarged heart with left-sided pleural effusion and mild pulmonary congestion, with possible calcification and percutaneous interventions in the left upper quadrant. No pneumothorax or significant changes in the position of gastrostomy or tracheostomy tubes.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with degenerative changes in the osseous structures, no evidence of large confluent consolidation or significant abnormalities in the lungs or glenohumeral joints. Recommend further evaluation of the cardiac abnormalities.
moderate cardiomegaly with possible hemorrhage and effusion in the left base, but overall stable pulmonary findings. Tracheostomy tube in place. Further evaluation recommended.
mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base, with no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
stable atelectasis with possible underlying infection, no evidence of PICC tip malposition, mild congestion in the lung bases and vascular structures.
bilateral bibasilar opacifications suggestive of possible consolidation or atelectasis, with bulging suggestive of possible pulmonary hypertension and enlargement of the right pleural space. Small effusion unchanged and edema slightly improved. Further evaluation recommended to determine underlying etiology.
stable cardiopulmonary status with no acute changes or significant findings.
