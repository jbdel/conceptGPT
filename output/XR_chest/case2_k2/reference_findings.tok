1 unchanged surgical clips and sternotomy wire fracture noted, with no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions. 2 Low volume consolidation suggestive of pneumonia is present, with no focal consolidation or evidence of edema. 3 A 1-2 cm calcified granuloma is unchanged, and there is no evidence of vascular or airspace abnormalities.
unchanged postoperative status with no acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Enlarged calcified nodule in posterior right lung base remains stable. No evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax.
possible calcified granulomatous disease with stable nodules suggestive of granulomas in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions, as well as a calcified nodule in the right hilar region. No evidence of active infection or malignancy.
1 moderately enlarged heart with mild congestion 2 possible effusion in the left upper quadrant with marked left pleural knob 3 percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes unchanged in standard position 4 streaky opacities minimally improved in the airspace with no evidence of pneumothorax 5 calcification in the bibasilar region and pulmonary vascular congestion 6 picc tip in place with no significant changes observed.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with degenerative changes in the osseous structures and glenohumeral joints, no evidence of large confluent consolidation or calcifications. Further evaluation may be necessary.
moderate cardiomegaly with possible pulmonary edema and left base opacity suggestive of hemorrhage. Tracheostomy tube in place with no acute fractures or displaced rib. Retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion unchanged from prior study. Enlarged pulmonary vasculature with possible aspiration effusion and mild opacity in the right lung. Further evaluation recommended.
1 mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and obscuration suggestive of edema in the right lung base 2 atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in the aortic arch 3 no acute pulmonary process identified, with no effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation 4 endotracheal and orogastric tubes unchanged and properly positioned 5 bibasilar atelectasis and markings, with minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base 6 otherwise clear cardiomediastinal contours and pulmonary vascular markings, with no free air or pleural effusion observed.
1 stable atelectasis at the left lung base with possible superimposed infection, clinical correlation recommended 2 mild cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion
possible consolidation and atelectasis in the bibasilar regions with bulging suggestive of enlargement in the right pleural area, and opacifications suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Small effusion unchanged. Edema slightly improved.
no acute cardiopulmonary abnormality, but there is evidence of calcification and moderate enlargement in the right upper extremity and arch. The endotracheal tube and PICC tip are in appropriate positions, and there is no large effusion or pneumothorax. The pleural and mediastinal areas appear clear, and there is no change in opacity in the left lower lobe.
