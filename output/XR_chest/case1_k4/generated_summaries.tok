no acute intrathoracic process, unchanged calcified granuloma, and fractured inferior sternotomy wire.
unchanged findings consistent with prior granulomatous disease and lymphadenopathy, no acute cardiopulmonary process.
evidence of prior granulomatous disease with calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base and pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence no acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with improvement in bibasilar airspace opacities and resolution of left pleural effusion. Left picc tip terminates in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein.
cardiomegaly with possible aortic arch calcification, but no definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
1 hazy opacity in the right lung may represent aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage 2 moderate cardiomegaly is stable 3 slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature with cephalization and enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with mild pulmonary edema
stable bibasilar atelectasis and trace pulmonary edema consistent with mild chronic heart failure, no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion, chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes.
mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis with possible superimposed infection, left picc tip not clearly visualized.
1 tracheostomy noted with unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette 2 bulging of pulmonary outflow tract suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3 slight improvement in pulmonary edema with unchanged small right pleural effusion 4 bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation
unchanged findings with persistent moderate cardiomegaly and calcification of the aortic arch.
