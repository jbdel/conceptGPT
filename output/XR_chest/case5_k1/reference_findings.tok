no acute intrathoracic process, stable calcified granuloma, and unchanged surgical clips and vascular markers related to prior cabg surgery.
Stable appearance of prior granulomatous disease with no evidence of acute intrathoracic process. Known lymph node enlargement and conglomerate account for observed findings. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities identified.
1 stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence 2 calcified nodule in the region of the posterior right lung base likely representing calcified granuloma secondary to prior granulomatous disease previously seen on ct 3 pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes better seen on ct with no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax
Moderate enlargement of the heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left pleural effusion has resolved and there is no pneumothorax identified. Left picc tip terminates in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein and tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged standard position. Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are minimally improved. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen in the left upper quadrant.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible positional accentuation, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. No evidence of large confluent consolidation or other significant abnormalities noted.
1 possible aspiration or pleural effusion in the right lung 2 stable retrocardiac opacity 3 mild pulmonary edema with slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature 4 no displaced rib fractures seen
stable bibasilar atelectasis and trace pulmonary edema consistent with mild chronic heart failure. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are noted. No evidence of acute pulmonary pathology such as pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Central venous and airway devices are appropriately positioned.
Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of atelectasis, with possible infection. Left picc tip not clearly delineated on current exam.
1. Tracheostomy noted 2. Bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract suggests underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3. Pulmonary edema has slightly improved compared to prior study 4. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged 5. Bibasilar opacifications are suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
stable findings with no significant interval change since the prior examination, with notable calcification of the aortic arch.
