1. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. 2. Right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low svc status post repositioning.  3. No significant interval change in moderate left pleural effusion or degree of left lower lung compressive atelectasis.  4. Decreased mild interstitial pulmonary edema. 5. Lungs are low in volume with no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 6. Calcified granuloma just below the medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged from prior study. 7. No pleural effusions or pulmonary edema. 8. Fractured inferior sternotomy wire and surgical clips and vascular markers in the thorax related to prior CABG surgery.
1 stable calcified pulmonary nodule consistent with prior granulomatous disease 2 enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes likely related to prior surgery 3 no acute cardiopulmonary process identified
1 calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease 2 pretracheal and right hilar lymph node conglomerate better evaluated on ct 3 no evidence of focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax 4 stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
moderate cardiomegaly with marked aortic knob calcification and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with improvement in bibasilar atelectasis and resolution of left pleural effusion.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible positional accentuation and low inspiratory effort, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints. No evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process.
right lung hazy opacity, retrocardiac opacity unchanged, stable moderate cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, tracheostomy tube in place, no displaced rib fractures. Possible aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage in the right lung.
Stable chest radiograph with minimal enlargement of cardiomediastinal contours consistent with mild chronic heart failure. Persistent obscuration of pulmonary vascular markings in right lung base consistent with trace pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis still present. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes noted.
persistent tracheostomy tube, left picc tip not clearly seen, mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis, possibility of infection cannot be excluded.
underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension with improvement in pulmonary edema, unchanged pleural effusion, and bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
Stable findings with no significant changes. The patient has a PICC line in place with its tip at the cavoatrial junction. There is no evidence of significant lung pathology, but the cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged with calcification of the aortic arch.
