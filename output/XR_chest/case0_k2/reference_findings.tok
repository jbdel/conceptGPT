no evidence of pneumonia or pleural effusion, unchanged calcified granuloma, fractured sternotomy wire, and surgical clips and vascular markers related to prior CABG surgery.
Stable calcified pulmonary nodule consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Enlarged right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes. No acute intrathoracic process. Status post median sternotomy and CABG with wires intact.
1. Calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease. 2. Pretracheal lymph node conglomerate and right hilar lymph nodes are better seen on CT. 3. No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. 4. Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, and bibasilar streaky airspace opacities. Left PICC tip and tracheostomy tube in unchanged position. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube seen in the left upper quadrant.
1 enlarged cardiac silhouette, possibly due to positioning and low inspiratory effort 2 calcifications at the aortic arch 3 degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally
right lung hazy opacity with possible aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage, stable retrocardiac opacity at left base, moderate cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema, and tracheostomy tube in place. No displaced rib fractures identified.
stable mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis, no acute findings of pneumothorax or pleural effusion, chronic atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes.
stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous and soft tissue structures, but mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis at the lung bases with possible infection. Left picc tip not clearly delineated.
pulmonary arterial hypertension with improvement in pulmonary edema, unchanged pleural effusion and atelectasis/consolidation in the lungs. Recommend further evaluation and management of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
1. Stable position of endotracheal tube, NG tube, and right upper extremity PICC with tip at cavoatrial junction.  2. No significant change in left lower lobe opacity or presence of large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  3. Moderately enlarged cardiac silhouette with calcification of the aortic arch noted in mediastinal contours.
