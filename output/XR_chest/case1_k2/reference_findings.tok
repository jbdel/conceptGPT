1 no acute intrathoracic process 2 unchanged calcified granuloma 3 inferior sternotomy wire fracture
Stable findings consistent with prior granulomatous disease and known lymph node enlargement. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified.
1 calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease 2 stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence
moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with improvement in bibasilar airspace opacities and resolution of left pleural effusion. Left picc tip terminates in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein.
cardiomegaly with possible aortic arch calcification, but no definite acute cardiopulmonary process. Degenerative changes noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally.
1 hazy opacity in the right lung may represent aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage 2 moderate cardiomegaly is stable 3 mild pulmonary edema with slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and enlarged pulmonary arteries 4 no displaced rib fractures.
stable mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and persistent bibasilar atelectasis. No acute findings of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes.
mild pulmonary vascular congestion and atelectasis at the lung bases, with possible infection. No significant change in the tracheostomy tube or picc line.
1 tracheostomy noted 2 enlargement of pulmonary arteries suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension 3 slight improvement in pulmonary edema compared to prior study 4 unchanged small right pleural effusion and bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
unchanged findings with persistent moderate cardiomegaly and calcification of the aortic arch in the mediastinum.
