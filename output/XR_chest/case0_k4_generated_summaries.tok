low lung volume without pneumonia, unchanged calcified granuloma, no pleural effusions or pneumothorax, and unchanged sternotomy wire fracture.



enlarged cardiac silhouette with calcifications at the aortic arch and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints, otherwise unremarkable chest radiograph.
1. Hazy opacity in the right lung may represent aspiration, pleural effusion, or hemorrhage. 2. Retrocardiac opacity at the left base is unchanged. 3. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. 4. Mild pulmonary edema with slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and enlarged pulmonary arteries.
stable cardiomegaly and trace pulmonary edema with persistent atelectasis. No acute intrathoracic abnormality.

pulmonary arterial hypertension with improvement in pulmonary edema, unchanged pleural effusion and bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation.
stable examination with no acute changes noted, but presence of calcification of the aortic arch should be monitored.
