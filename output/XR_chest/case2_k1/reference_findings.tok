unchanged postoperative changes with new consolidation in the left lung suggestive of pneumonia, and a stable calcified granuloma in the right lung. No evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
unchanged pulmonary status post median sternotomy CABG with an enlarged, round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base and increased opacity in the pleural fullness. No effusion or pneumothorax present. Granulomatous appearance in the cardiac silhouette size and hilar contours with wires intact.
There are multiple calcified nodules and conglomerates throughout the lungs, suggestive of possible calcified granulomatous disease. There are no signs of acute cardiopulmonary process, no effusion, and no pneumothorax. The mediastinal silhouettes appear slightly decreased in prominence, and there are stable nodules suggestive of granuloma in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions. There is also a possible calcified granuloma in the right hilar region. Lymph nodes are present but not significantly enlarged.
Moderate enlargement of the heart with mild congestion and possible effusion in the left upper quadrant. Streaky opacities minimally improved with no evidence of pneumothorax. Calcification and marked left pleural knob present. Percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes unchanged in standard position. Further evaluation of pulmonary vascular and airspace involvement may be necessary.
mild cardiomegaly with degenerative changes and calcifications, without evidence of large confluent consolidation or acute cardiopulmonary process. Osseous changes noted, particularly in the glenohumeral joints. Further evaluation may be warranted.
The chest x-ray shows possible aspiration or effusion in the retrocardiac region with unchanged opacity suggestive of effusion. There is no evidence of displaced fractures, but there is mild pulmonary edema and hazy opacity in the left base. The pulmonary vasculature is enlarged with cephalization and mild cardiomegaly. There is a tracheostomy tube in place. The right lung shows possible hemorrhage. Overall, there is moderate cardiomegaly and slight prominence with opacity suggestive of hemorrhage.
mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base, with atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in the aortic arch. No acute intrathoracic process identified, with bibasilar atelectasis and no effusion or pneumothorax. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes unchanged and positioned, with otherwise clear pulmonary markings and normal cardiomediastinal contours.
stable left lower lobe atelectasis with possible underlying infection and mild vascular congestion in the lung bases. No evidence of PICC line tip.
Possible pulmonary hypertension with bibasilar opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis. Unchanged bulging in the right pleural space with possible enlargement. Small effusion unchanged. Mild improvement in pulmonary arterial edema. Further evaluation recommended.
Stable chest radiograph with no acute cardiopulmonary process identified. There is an unchanged endotracheal tube in place and a moderately enlarged calcified arch. No pneumothorax or large effusion is present. The PICC tip is visible and there is no change in opacity in the left lower lobe.
