unchanged pulmonary volume with no evidence of effusions or pneumothorax. Fractured sternotomy wire and calcified granuloma remain unchanged. Consolidation suggestive of pneumonia present, but no focal consolidation observed. No evidence of pleural edema or vascular abnormalities.
Overall, the pulmonary and mediastinal contours appear normal and unchanged. There is a conglomerate in the posterior right lung base and an enlarged, round calcified nodule that remains unchanged. The wires are intact and there is an increased opacity with pleural fullness, but no focal consolidation or effusion. The cardiac silhouette size is normal and there is granulomatous tissue in the right paratracheal region. No pneumothorax is present.
Findings suggestive of possible calcified granulomatous disease, with stable nodules in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base regions. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Follow-up imaging may be warranted to further evaluate these findings.
Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with mild congestion and streaky opacities minimally improved. Calcification and marked enlargement of the left heart with pulmonary vascular congestion. Percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes unchanged in standard position. No evidence of pneumothorax.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with no large confluent consolidation seen. Lungs show mild osseous and degenerative changes. Calcifications are noted. Glenohumeral joints appear normal. Further evaluation may be necessary to assess for any underlying cardiac or pulmonary conditions.
Moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and hazy opacity in the left base suggestive of possible hemorrhage. Tracheostomy tube in place with no displaced fractures noted. Retrocardiac opacity unchanged and suggestive of effusion. Pulmonary arteries enlarged with no evidence of pulmonary edema. Consider further evaluation for possible aspiration effusion.
Minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base with atherosclerotic calcification and obscuration suggestive of edema. Mild chronic heart failure with no effusion or pneumothorax. Atelectasis and trace edema present. Otherwise clear with no catheter or endotracheal tube changes. Markings present in the bibasilar region and pulmonary vascular system. Aortic arch and pleural and degenerative changes noted. Orogastric tube unchanged and positioned, and left internal jugular central venous obscuration present. Cardiomediastinal contours normal with bilateral glenohumeral joint findings.
stable findings with possible atelectasis and opacities suggestive of infection in the left lung base. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality identified. Recommend follow-up imaging to assess resolution of atelectasis and possible infection.
The imaging findings suggest possible pulmonary hypertension with unchanged bulging and small effusion. There are opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis, with possible enlargement and consolidation in the right pleural area. Pulmonary arterial edema is slightly improved. Further evaluation with additional imaging and clinical correlation is recommended.
stable chest radiograph with no acute changes noted.
