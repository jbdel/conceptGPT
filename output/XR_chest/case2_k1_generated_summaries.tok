Consolidation suggestive of pneumonia with no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Unchanged surgical clips and markers, with a fractured sternotomy wire. Calcified granuloma unchanged. No evidence of focal consolidation or pulmonary edema.
Overall, the pulmonary and mediastinal contours appear normal and unchanged. There is a conglomerate of wires intact in the right hilum, and the cardiac silhouette size is within normal limits. The previously noted enlarged, round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base remains unchanged. There is increased opacity and pleural fullness, but no focal consolidation, effusion, or pneumothorax. The granulomatous appearance in the right paratracheal region suggests a possible benign etiology. This is all consistent with the patient's status post median sternotomy CABG.
stable calcified nodules in the right paratracheal and posterior right lung base, suggestive of granulomatous disease. No evidence of acute infection or effusion. Possible slight decrease in mediastinal lymph node prominence. Further evaluation may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.
Moderate left-sided pleural effusion with mild congestion and streaky opacities minimally improved. No evidence of pneumothorax or acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. Calcification and knob in the left upper quadrant, with marked left pleural involvement. Percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes unchanged in standard position. Further evaluation recommended.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with no large confluent consolidation, and degenerative changes and calcifications seen in the osseous structures and glenohumeral joints.
1 no evidence of displaced fractures or tracheostomy tube complications 2 pulmonary opacity at left base suggestive of possible aspiration effusion or resolving infection, recommend follow up imaging in weeks for resolution 3 moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence of pulmonary vasculature, suggestive of possible pulmonary edema or hemorrhage, further evaluation recommended.
mild chronic heart failure with trace edema and minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base. Atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes in the aortic arch are noted. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Endotracheal and orogastric tubes remain unchanged in position. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. Pulmonary vascular markings and bibasilar atelectasis are present. Cardiomediastinal contours are obscured suggestive of edema. Left internal jugular central venous catheter is not visualized. Bilateral glenohumeral joints are unremarkable.
1 stable atelectasis with streaky opacities in the left lung base 2 possible infection, further evaluation recommended
Findings are suggestive of possible pulmonary hypertension and atelectasis, with some improvement in edema. There are also opacifications suggestive of consolidation and enlargement in the right pleural area. A small effusion remains unchanged. Further evaluation may be necessary.
No significant changes noted in the right upper extremity or lungs. Endotracheal tube and PICC tip are in appropriate positions. Mild calcification of the arch is present. No pneumothorax or large effusion seen. Mediastinal and pleural spaces are clear. No significant changes in opacity of the left lower lobe.
