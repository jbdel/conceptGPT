The patient's lungs appear to have normal volume with no effusions or edema present. However, there is consolidation suggestive of pneumonia and a 1-2 cm calcified granuloma that remains unchanged. The surgical clips are also unchanged, but there is a fractured sternotomy wire. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or focal consolidation. The vascular and airspace appear normal with no signs of pneumonia. Overall, the impression is that the patient may be experiencing pneumonia and has a pre-existing calcified granuloma.
The pulmonary system appears normal with unchanged mediastinal contours. There is a conglomerate in the right paratracheal region, which is unchanged from previous status post median sternotomy CABG. An enlarged, round calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base is also unchanged. The wires are intact and the right hilum and cardiac silhouette size are normal. There is a granulomatous appearance in the hilar contours. No effusion or pneumothorax is present, but there is increased opacity and pleural fullness. No focal consolidation is noted.
The chest radiograph shows stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with no evidence of effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. There is a possible slight decrease in prominence of the mediastinal silhouettes. A calcified nodule is present in the posterior right lung base, suggestive of a granuloma. There is also a conglomerate of lymph nodes in the right paratracheal region. The overall impression is of possible calcified granulomatous disease, with a nodule suggestive of granuloma in the right hilar region.
The chest X-ray shows moderately enlarged heart with streaky opacities minimally improved in the left upper quadrant. There is possible effusion and mild congestion in the left pleural airspace. No pneumothorax is observed. Calcification is noted in the pulmonary vascular knob. The gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes are unchanged in their standard position. Overall, the findings suggest a potential pulmonary and cardiac pathology that requires further evaluation.
The cardiac silhouette appears normal, but there are signs of enlarged lungs. No large confluent consolidation is present, but there are calcifications and degenerative changes in the osseous structures. Additionally, there are findings of glenohumeral joint abnormalities. Further evaluation may be necessary to fully assess these findings.
The patient's pulmonary system shows some concerning findings, including opacity suggestive of effusion and possible aspiration effusion. There is also an opacity unchanged in the retrocardiac area. The pulmonary arteries appear enlarged, and there are no displaced fractures. The vasculature is also enlarged, and there is a tracheostomy tube in place. The left base shows a mild, stable haziness, and there is moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence. There is also an opacity suggestive of hemorrhage and possible hemorrhage in the right lung. Overall, further evaluation and monitoring are necessary to determine the extent and cause of these findings.
The pulmonary exam revealed minimal stable enlargement in the right lung base, along with atherosclerotic calcification. There was also obscuration suggestive of edema, which may be related to mild chronic heart failure. The left internal jugular central venous line was in place, and there was no evidence of catheter-related complications. The cardiomediastinal contours were otherwise clear, with no evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. There were degenerative changes noted in the aortic arch, and pleural markings were present. The endotracheal tube and orogastric tube were unchanged and appropriately positioned. Bilateral glenohumeral joint exam was unremarkable. Overall, the pulmonary vascular exam was concerning for trace edema and atelectasis, but no significant abnormalities were noted.
The imaging findings suggest the presence of atelectasis with possible infection. The absence of the PICC tip and the streaky opacities in the left lung base are concerning. However, the patient's condition appears stable, and there are no significant changes in the vascular or cardiomediastinal silhouette. Mild congestion is also noted. The opacities are suggestive of atelectasis, and further evaluation is recommended to rule out any underlying pathology.
The imaging findings suggest possible pulmonary hypertension with bulging suggestive of enlargement in the right pleural region. There are opacifications suggestive of consolidation and atelectasis in the bibasilar region, with possible consolidation. There is also a small effusion that is unchanged. The pulmonary arterial system is involved, with opacifications seen. Edema is slightly improved. Further evaluation and management are recommended.
The patient's condition appears to be relatively stable, with no significant changes noted in the right upper extremity or the endotracheal tube. There is evidence of moderate enlargement and calcification in the arch, but no signs of pneumothorax or large effusion. The picc tip is in the appropriate position, and there is no significant change in opacity in the left lower lobe. The pleural and mediastinal areas appear to be normal, and there is no evidence of NG-related complications. Overall, the patient's condition remains unchanged.
