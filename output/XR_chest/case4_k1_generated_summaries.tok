No significant findings suggestive of acute pulmonary pathology.
Stable granulomatous disease with unchanged calcified pulmonary nodule and known lymph node conglomerates. No acute intrathoracic process identified. Status post median sternotomy and CABG with wires intact.
1. Findings consistent with a calcified granuloma in the posterior right lung base, likely secondary to prior granulomatous disease.  2. Pretracheal and right hilar lymph node conglomerates are better seen on CT, but no evidence of active disease or focal consolidation is seen.  3. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  4. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with a possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence.
Moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left PICC tip terminates in the distal left brachiocephalic vein and tracheostomy tube is in unchanged standard position. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved and no pneumothorax is identified. Bibasilar streaky airspace opacities are minimally improved. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen in the left upper quadrant.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette with calcifications at the aortic arch and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints. No significant lung abnormalities identified.
complicated with possible aspiration, effusion, and hemorrhage in the right lung, stable retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion, moderate cardiomegaly, and mild pulmonary edema with enlarged pulmonary arteries. No displaced rib fractures noted. Tracheostomy tube in place. Further evaluation and management recommended.
Stable findings of mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are noted. No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality is seen.
Possible atelectasis with mild pulmonary vascular congestion and streaky opacities at the lung bases. Left PICC tip not clearly delineated. No significant changes in the cardiomediastinal silhouette or osseous and soft tissue structures. Infection cannot be excluded. Follow-up imaging may be necessary.
Bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation, with unchanged bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension. Small right pleural effusion remains unchanged. Pulmonary edema has slightly improved compared to prior study. Further evaluation for pulmonary arterial hypertension is recommended.
Stable findings with no significant changes. Notable calcification of the aortic arch. No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
