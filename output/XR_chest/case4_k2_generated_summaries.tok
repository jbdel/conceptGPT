Stable granulomatous disease with no acute intrathoracic abnormality.

moderately enlarged heart with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. Left picc tip terminates in the region of the distal left brachiocephalic vein. Tracheostomy tube and percutaneous gastrostomy tube are in unchanged standard positions. No pneumothorax is identified.
enlarged cardiac silhouette with possible positional accentuation, calcifications at the aortic arch, and degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints. No evidence of large confluent consolidation in the lungs.
Possible aspiration or hemorrhage in the right lung with moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. No evidence of displaced rib fractures or effusion. Tracheostomy tube in place. Retrocardiac opacity at the left base is unchanged. Further evaluation is recommended.

Possible atelectasis and infection, with mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left PICC tip not clearly delineated. Comparison with previous exam recommended for further evaluation.

stable radiographic findings with no significant changes since previous imaging, notable for calcification of the aortic arch and no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
