low lung volume with no focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Fractured inferior sternotomy wire and unchanged surgical clips and vascular markers related to prior CABG surgery. No pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Unchanged 1-2 cm calcified granuloma below the medial aspect of the right hemidiaphragm.
Stable granulomatous disease with unchanged calcified pulmonary nodule and enlarged right hilar lymph node. No acute cardiopulmonary process identified. Status post median sternotomy and CABG with wires intact.
Stable cardiopulmonary status with possible prior granulomatous disease and calcified granuloma in the region of the posterior right lung base. Pretracheal and right hilar lymph node conglomerate better evaluated on CT. No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Possible slight decrease in right paratracheal prominence. Follow-up imaging may be warranted to monitor stability of nodules and lymph nodes.
Moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No significant interval change in the previously noted findings of left PICC tip terminating in the distal left brachiocephalic vein, bibasilar streaky airspace opacities minimally improved, and previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. No evidence of pneumothorax. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube seen in the left upper quadrant. Tracheostomy tube is in an unchanged standard position.
cardiomegaly with possible positional accentuation, no significant pulmonary pathology, degenerative changes at the glenohumeral joints, and calcifications at the aortic arch.
Right lung hazy opacity may represent aspiration or hemorrhage, retrocardiac opacity unchanged and suggestive of effusion, moderate stable cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary edema with slight prominence of pulmonary vasculature and enlarged pulmonary arteries. Tracheostomy tube in place. No displaced rib fractures. Further evaluation recommended to determine the cause of the right lung opacity.
1 mild chronic heart failure with trace pulmonary edema in the right lung base 2 persistent bibasilar atelectasis 3 atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are chronic findings 4 no acute pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified 5 left internal jugular central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and orogastric tube are appropriately positioned and unchanged.
Stable cardiopulmonary exam with possible atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion. Left PICC tip not clearly delineated on current exam. Infection cannot be excluded.
1. Tracheostomy noted 2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension suggested by bulging of pulmonary outflow tract 3. Pulmonary edema slightly improved compared to prior study 4. Bibasilar opacifications suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation 5. Small right pleural effusion unchanged 6. No acute intrathoracic abnormality otherwise
findings consistent with stable clinical status and no acute changes. Notable calcification of the aortic arch. No evidence of significant pulmonary pathology or complications related to the endotracheal tube, NG tube, or PICC line.
