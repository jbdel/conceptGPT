stable cardiopulmonary status with no acute findings. Chronic calcified granuloma and fractured sternotomy wire related to prior surgery.
Stable round calcified pulmonary nodule in the posterior right lung base consistent with prior granulomatous disease. Enlarged right hilar lymph node and right mediastinal lymph node conglomerate unchanged from prior imaging. No evidence of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or focal consolidation. Status post median sternotomy and CABG with wires intact. Normal cardiac silhouette size and unchanged mediastinal and hilar contours.
Stable cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes with a calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base suggestive of prior granulomatous disease and pretracheal and right hilar lymph node conglomerates. No evidence of active disease or pleural effusion/pneumothorax.
Moderate cardiomegaly with marked calcification of the aortic knob. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion with bibasilar streaky airspace opacities minimally improved. Previously noted left pleural effusion appears to have resolved. No pneumothorax identified. Placement of left PICC and percutaneous gastrostomy tube seen. Tracheostomy tube in unchanged standard position.
Enlarged cardiac silhouette with no evidence of large confluent consolidation. Calcifications noted at the aortic arch and degenerative changes noted at the glenohumeral joints bilaterally. Otherwise unremarkable osseous and soft tissue structures.
moderate cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema and possible aspiration or hemorrhage in the right lung, and a pleural effusion or hemorrhage in the left base. No displaced rib fractures identified. Tracheostomy tube in place. Follow-up imaging recommended to monitor changes.
Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates little interval change when compared to prior study performed 24 hours ago. There is minimal stable enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours consistent with mild chronic heart failure. Persistent obscuration of the pulmonary vascular markings in the right lung base is consistent with trace pulmonary edema. Bibasilar atelectasis is still present. The lungs are otherwise clear. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion is seen. The left internal jugular central venous catheter, endotracheal tube, and orogastric tube are unchanged and appropriately positioned. Chronic findings of atherosclerotic calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative changes are once again noted.
Possible atelectasis and mild pulmonary vascular congestion, with no clear delineation of the left PICC tip. Infection cannot be excluded. Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette and osseous/soft tissue structures.
Findings suggest underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension with enlargement of pulmonary arteries and bulging of the pulmonary outflow tract. Pulmonary edema has slightly improved compared to prior study. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged. Bibasilar opacifications are noted and suggestive of atelectasis or consolidation. Tracheostomy is noted.
stable findings with no acute cardiopulmonary process, notable for calcification of the aortic arch.
