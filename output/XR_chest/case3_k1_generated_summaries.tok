Unchanged surgical clips and markers with no evidence of effusions or edema. Low volume lungs with consolidation suggestive of pneumonia and a 1-2 cm calcified granuloma unchanged. Fractured sternotomy wire and no evidence of pneumothorax or focal consolidation. Vascular and airspace appear normal with no signs of pneumonia.
1 unchanged mediastinal contours with no evidence of new pulmonary abnormalities 2 conglomerate of wires and unchanged calcified nodule in the posterior right lung base, likely related to prior surgery 3 enlarged right hilum with granulomatous changes and hilar contours, suggestive of prior infection or inflammation 4 increased opacity and fullness in the pleural space, but no evidence of focal consolidation or effusion.
stable calcified nodules in the right hilar and posterior right lung base, suggestive of granulomatous disease. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. Mediastinal and cardiac silhouettes are within normal limits, with possible slight decrease in prominence of lymph nodes. A stable nodule is also noted in the right paratracheal region, possibly suggestive of a calcified granuloma. No focal consolidation or conglomerate masses are seen. Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.
1. Moderately enlarged heart with calcification in the left upper quadrant and marked left pleural knob. 2. Streaky opacities minimally improved, possibly reflecting airspace disease or effusion. 3. No evidence of pneumothorax. 4. Pulmonary vascular markings are bibasilar. 5. Percutaneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes are unchanged in standard positions. 6. The picc tip is in an appropriate position. 7. Mild congestion is present.
enlarged cardiac silhouette and lungs with degenerative changes and calcifications, without evidence of large confluent consolidation. Osseous findings include calcifications in the glenohumeral joints.
Stable pulmonary findings with no significant changes compared to prior imaging. Possible aspiration effusion and retrocardiac opacity suggestive of effusion. Mild hazy opacity in left base and moderate cardiomegaly with slight prominence. Possible hemorrhage in right lung. Tracheostomy tube in place. No displaced fractures. Enlarged vasculature.
1 minimal stable enlargement of the right lung base with obscuration suggestive of edema, likely due to mild chronic heart failure. No evidence of effusion or pneumothorax. 2 Atherosclerotic calcification and degenerative changes noted in the aortic arch. 3 Atelectasis and trace edema present, with no evidence of pleural effusion. 4 Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube unchanged in position. 5 Bilateral glenohumeral joint findings are unremarkable. Follow-up imaging may be warranted to monitor for any changes in pulmonary and cardiac function.
Stable left lung with streaky opacities suggestive of atelectasis and possible infection. No evidence of picc tip. Mild congestion noted in the vascular and cardiomediastinal silhouette at the lung bases.
Findings are suggestive of possible pulmonary hypertension with associated consolidation and atelectasis. There is also a small unchanged effusion and enlargement of the right pleural space. Further evaluation is recommended.
stable findings with no significant changes observed in the right upper extremity, pleural and mediastinal regions, and left lower lobe. The endotracheal tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax or large effusion. There is moderate enlargement and calcification of the arch, and the PICC tip is in an expected position. No significant changes in opacity were noted.
