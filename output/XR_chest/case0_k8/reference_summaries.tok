no evidence of acute cardiopulmonary process 
no acute cardiopulmonary process 
no radiographic findings to suggest pneumonia 
1 left picc tip appears to terminate in the distal left brachiocephalic vein 2 mild pulmonary vascular congestion 3 interval improvement in aeration of the lung bases with residual streaky opacity likely reflective of atelectasis interval resolution of the left pleural effusion 
no definite acute cardiopulmonary process enlarged cardiac silhouette could be accentuated by patient s positioning 
1 hazy opacity in the right lung which may represent aspiration versus pleural effusion or hemorrhage 2 mild pulmonary edema 3 no displaced rib fractures 
1 mild chronic congestive heart failure with stable trace pulmonary edema at the right lung base 2 stable bibasilar atelectasis 
no significant interval change since prior pulmonary vascular congestion bibasilar opacities potentially due to atelectasis however infection is not excluded 
1 unchanged bibasilar opacities are consistent with atelectasis or consolidation and pneumonia should be considered in the appropriate clinical context 2 improved pulmonary edema 
mild residual retrocardiac opacification remains pneumonia vs atelectasis
